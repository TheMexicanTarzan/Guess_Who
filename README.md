# Guess_Who
A Pokemon-themed variant of the popular guessing game "Guess Who?" 

A random pokemon will be chosen. Each one with a randomly chosen moveset. You will be given 4 guesses in which you will try to deduce the pokemon's class, moves and name. Each guess, wether right or wrong, will discard pokemons accordingly.
